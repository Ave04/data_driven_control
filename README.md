# Data-driven control for autonomous robotics systems

## Introduction
The past couple of years has seen growing interest in the field of robotics. Automating
tasks through robotic systems has gradually become the de facto practice in industry and
continues to bloom as more effective control systems are established. This demonstrates
a constant need for efficiency as optimal control is sought after to reduce human effort
and improve repeatability as well as reliability of certain tasks. More notably, the concept
of learning from data has become more prevalent in the current landscape, influencing a
paradigm shift towards novel control strategies.

### Motivation
Data-driven or machine-learning control, however, is not novel in itself. Contributions
to the method can be found in the works of Zielger and Nichols [1] and similarities are
prolific throughout other control strategies, such as Model-Predictive Control (MPC)
and adaptive control [2], as well as artificial neural networks (ANNs) [3]. As such, it is
only evident that current research seeks to tap into the practical potential of data-driven
methods.
